              In my previous life, I was a freelance translator working from
              German into English, translating primarily computer games along
              with finance materials. After ten years in the industry, my
              intense curiosity for programming was sparked when I happened to
              meet a graduate of General Assembly’s 3-month software engineering
              immersive at just the right time! I was hooked almost instantly,
              and I quickly decided on a total career change. I eagerly moved
              into software engineering, where my linguistic skills have proven
              to be a big asset. Dedicated, highly driven and always eager to
              learn, I’m passionate about the challenges I encounter in my
              programming journey and the opportunities for collaboration that
              this career path brings. I’m currently looking for opportunities
              to further develop my skills and move into a full stack role where
              I can utilise my abilities to their fullest potential.
