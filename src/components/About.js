              Being driven by a passion for picking up new skills, new information
              and deciding how best to implement it, I transitioned from a
              career in translation into software engineering, and what I've
              found since then is a whole world of opportunities to do what I
              love most - to learn, to collaborate, and to create.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love collaborating with a team of devs to build and test new
              features, building out components that anticipate technical and
              business needs while liaising with client-facing stakeholders.
              Working together and communicating well is the key to great
              development, so I'm always rubber ducking with the team to talk
              through challenges, sharing ideas and solutions with teammates,
              and iterating through code to make it as lean and high-performing
              as possible definitely. I've found it's crucial to proactively
              skill up on new technologies and the latest updates so I'm always
              up-to-speed, and I always share what I learn.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a software engineer, I have a good eye for detail, efficient
              time management skills, and an open and friendly communication
              style. Coupled with a passion for writing code that meets the
              needs of clients and businesses in the most elegant way possible,
              I'm always learning and improving.
            </p>
            <p>
              But I'm not content with simply meeting those needs: I aim to
              exceed them.
