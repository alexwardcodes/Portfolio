    "aboutme":"In my previous life, I was a freelance translator working from German into English, translating primarily computer games along with finance materials. I began to lose the love of the job though, and my intense curiosity for programming was sparked when I happened to meet a graduate of General Assembly’s 3-month software engineering immersive at just the right time! I was hooked almost instantly, and I quickly decided on a total career change. I eagerly moved into software engineering, where my linguistic skills have proven to be a big asset. Dedicated, highly driven and always eager to learn, I’m passionate about the challenges I encounter in my programming journey and the opportunities for collaboration that this career path brings. I’m currently looking for opportunities to further develop my skills and move into a full stack role where I can utilise my abilities to their fullest potential.",
